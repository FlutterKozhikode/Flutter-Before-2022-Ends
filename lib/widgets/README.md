# üëΩ Widgets

In this directory you will find all the widgets that we have discussed in the meet. 

Just a bit of information about the widgets is here:

## ChoiceChip

Code: [lib/widgets/choice_chip.dart](./choice_chips.dart)

## Expanded

[Expanded](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Expanded-class.html) widget expands a child of a [Row](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Row-class.html), [Column](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Column-class.html), or [Flex](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Flex-class.html) so that the child fills the available space.

Optionally, the child can be sized to fill the available space using the [flex](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Expanded/flex.html) property.

Code: [lib/widgets/expanded.dart](./expanded.dart)

## ExpansionTile

## Hero

[Hero](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Hero-class.html) is a widget that marks its child as being a candidate for hero animations.
